## Introduction

CSESoc Projects' Degree Planner (Plannify & Pathways)

This project contains a Web Application that allows UNSW students to plan, optimise and prepare their degree progression. Plannify allows students to
organise when they complete courses that are requirements for their degree, while Pathways allows students to visually determine the prerequisites and postrequisites
of a specified course via a generated flow chart.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

The project has been verified to work on the following dependencies

* npm v5.8.0
* yarn v1.17.3

This project is designed to be run on a UNIX based machine (Mac or Linux).

## Deployment

### Running the Web App locally

The below will clone the repo, install the dependencies and run both the front end and back end concurrently.
```
git clone https://github.com/csesoc/degree-planner.git
cd degree-planner
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can then visit ```http://localhost:3000/``` for the front end and ```http://localhost:3001/``` for the back end

### Running the client locally

```
git clone https://github.com/csesoc/degree-planner.git
cd degree-planner/client
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can then visit ```http://localhost:3000/``` for the front end

### Running the server locally

```
git clone https://github.com/csesoc/degree-planner.git
cd degree-planner/server
yarn install
yarn start
```

You can then visit ```http://localhost:3001/``` for the back end

### Configuring Postgres

* Request the `.env` file from the current CSESoc Projects Team Lead or CSESoc Projects Director(s)
* Place the `.env` file at ```~/degree-planner/server/.env```
